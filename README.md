# Employee Management

## Paths and URL's
URL to intranet: `https://172.29.0.29/intranet/`
Path to Intranet: `\\172.29.0.29\www\html\intranet`

## SETUP FOR DB: 
Open .env file and scroll to the bottom. The following settings are available there:

```conf
# DB CONNECTION - Default
db.default.host=localhost
db.default.username=root
db.default.password=
db.default.dbname=intranet
db.default.charset=UTF8
```

## Code Lifecycle
The entire `MVC` system runs in the `system` namespace. Then I created more namespaces within system to be consistent with the folder structure.
I created some handy constants immediately like `DS` - Short for DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR because Linux and Windows have different characters for separating directories, not safe to just use `/` 


> `index.php` _ns: root_
```apache
Declare and Parse environment variables `.env` file in the root
```
---

> `system/extensions/env/init.php` _ns: system\extensions\env_
```apache
Parses .env file in the `root`
```
---

> `system/constants.php`
```apache
- Declare some constants for debuging
  - Display Errors On/Off
  - Error Reporting On/Off
  - Log Errors On/Off
  - Error Log Path
```

> `system/bootstrap` _ns: system_
```apache
- includes the rest of the files required to run MVC
  - General Helper with handy functions for global use
  - Request Helper for handling $_GET and $_POST super globals
  - Exception Handler that registers a function to catch all errors
  - Base Data Singleton Class that keeps all data in a central, always consistent place. This can be accessed from any controller by using $this->set and $this->get and it uses a custom dot notation:
    - person.hobbies:0.hobbyName Equal to $person->hobbies[0]->hobbyName
    - employee.name would contain the employee name
    - employee.groups would contain an array with his groups
    - employee.groups:0.name contain group name
  - Load Handler that autoloads all classes as they are requested and because the system has got namespaces the same as the folder structure the system alwats knows where to go look for the requested class
  - Application that handles all incoming requests
    - The .htaccess file has a rewrite rule that directs all traffic to the index file
    - Every `/` caries an argument
      - The word after the first `/` is the requested contoller
      - The word after the second `/` is the method to be called
      - All the rest of the `/` are arguments sent to the method
      - This then skips the need for a router class\
```
Then the lifecycle ends with the `render` method that is part of the controller class that is extended by all other controllers
The `render` method uses a small custom `templating engine` where I can create `re-usable layouts` and code `fragments` that I can `include` anywhere as needed


## Project Structure
### Single point of entry
  
__To Support `https`__
```php
    Example of setting a .env variable in this file
    setEnv document.root %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}

    Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
    RewriteRule ^.*$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [R,L]
```

Added `.htacces` file with rewrite rules enabled

All trafic directed to `index.php`
After 1st `/` will be sent as query paramater `controller` 
After 2nd `/` will be sent as query paramater `action` 
After 3nd `/` and the ones following that will be in the `params` query parameter

## System Extensions
### Database
> Created a database class that uses MySQLi
MySQLi has prepared statement, this will prevent SQL injection

__Connect to DB__
```php
    // Conections are specified in the .env file, the default connection is called `default`
    $db = new DB('connection_name')`
```

__Fetch a row__
```php
    $user = $db->query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?', 'test', 'test')->fetchArray();
    echo $user['name'];
```
__OR__
```php
    $user = $db->query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?',['test', 'test'])->fetchArray();
    echo $user['name'];
```

__Fetch multiple rows__
```php
    $users = $db->query('SELECT * FROM users')->fetchAll();
    foreach ($users as $user) {
        echo $user['name'] . '<br>';
    }
```

__Using a callback function__
> if you do not want the results being stored in an array (useful for large amounts of data)
```php
    $db->query('SELECT * FROM users')->fetchAll(function($user) {
        echo $user['name'];
    });
```
If you need to break the loop:  `return 'break'; ` 

__Get the number of rows__
```php
    $users = $db->query('SELECT * FROM users');
    echo $users->numRows();
```

__Get the affected number of rows__
```php
    $insert = $db->query('INSERT INTO users (username,password,email,name) VALUES (?,?,?,?)', 'test', 'test', 'test@gmail.com', 'Test');
    echo $insert->affectedRows();
```

__Get the total number of queries__
```php
    echo $db->query_count;
```

__Get the last insert ID__
```php
    echo $db->lastInsertID();
```

__Close the database__
```php
    $db->close();
```

### Views
> I created a View Templating class that can be used like this

Specify template te render
```php
View::render('layout');
```

Create a new HTML file and name it layoutreturn mixed and add:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>{% yield title %}</title>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
	</head>
	<body>
    {% yield content %}
    </body>
</html>
```

Now create the indexreturn mixed file and add:
```html
{% extends layoutreturn mixed %}

{% block title %}Home Page{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<h1>Home</h1>
<p>Welcome to the home page!</p>
{% endblock %}
```

Or the template can be called like this
```php
Template::view('aboutreturn mixed', [
    'title' => 'Home Page',
    'colors' => ['red','blue','green']
]);
```

And then we can use it as so:
```html
    {% extends layoutreturn mixed %}

    {% block title %}{{ $title }}{% endblock %}

    {% block content %}
    <h1>Home</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the home page, list of colors:</p>
    <ul>
        {% foreach($colors as $color): %}
        <li>{{ $color }}</li>
        {% endforeach; %}
    </ul>
    {% endblock %}
```

Extend blocks:
```html
    {% block content %}
    @parent
    <p>Extends content block!</p>
    {% endblock %}
```

Include additional template files:
```html
{% include formsreturn mixed %}
```

If we want to remove all the compiled files we can either delete all the files in the cache directory or execute the following code:
```php
View::clearCache();
```

### Model
The Model base class `implements` the `IteratorAgregate` that makes it possible to use your `models`
as an `array` and go through the records with `loops` like `foreach`

In each model you must specify the `table` name and the `key` column of the `table`
```php
class Employee extends Model {

    function __construct($id = null) {
        $this->table = 'employees';
        $this->orderBy = 'employment_date';
        parent::__construct($id,true);
    }
}
```
- By specifying the `$id` the record with that `id` will be fetched
- If the `$orderBy` is specified then the records will be ordered that way
- If the `second argument` is set to `true` then all the records in the table will be fetched


## DB Tables, Foreign keys and Indexes
> I created 2 tables
1. `groups` table that contains a list of employee groups
2. `employee_groups` this table carries the relations between the employees and the group(s) they belong to

> Then I added the following indexes and contraints
1. I added some foreign keys that will cascade delete the relations if an employee is deleted.
2. a Group can also not be deleted if any emloyees belong to that group
3. I added in index to the `active` column in the `employees` table, this might be used a lot to `filter`
4. I added a unique index to the `employee_code` column so that there can't be duplicate `codes`
5. I did not add any indexes to the employee_groups table becuase all `keys` / `foreign keys` are `auto indexed`
6. I also indexed the `start_date` because of the `ordering` in the `column`

## Error Pages
I added error pages for the most of the popular errors:
- Error `400` - Bad Request
- Error `401` - Unauthorized (RFC 7235)
- Error `402` - Payment Required
- Error `403` - Forbidden
- Error `404` - Not Found
- Error `500` - Internal Server Error
